# Android Java Demo 2 Dagger 2 Field Injection

Dagger 2 is a popular dependency injection framework for Java and Android development. It provides a way to handle object dependencies and perform dependency injection using compile-time code generation.

Field injection is one of the approaches offered by Dagger 2 to inject dependencies into an object. It allows you to inject dependencies directly into fields of a class without the need for explicit constructor or method injection.
